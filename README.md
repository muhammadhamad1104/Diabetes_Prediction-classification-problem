Neural Network Model for Multi-Class Classification
Overview
This project is focused on building a neural network for multi-class classification using a structured dataset. The main goal was to implement a simple yet effective neural network model while ensuring optimal performance through robust preprocessing and careful evaluation.

Features
A single hidden layer neural network with 32 neurons using ReLU activation.
Softmax output layer for multi-class classification.
Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.01.
Early stopping to avoid overfitting.
Dataset and Preprocessing
The dataset was preprocessed to improve the performance and generalizability of the model:

Standardization of numerical features.
Encoding of categorical features.
Splitting the data into Training (70%), Validation (15%), and Test (15%) sets.
Model Training
The model was trained using the Sparse Categorical Cross Entropy loss function.
Training used early stopping after validation loss failed to improve for five epochs, halting at epoch 49.
Results
The model achieved the following metrics on the test dataset:

Test Loss: 0.1148
Test Accuracy: 96.0%
Precision:
Class 0: 0.97
Class 1: 0.88
Recall:
Class 0: 0.99
Class 1: 0.63
F1-Score:
Class 0: 0.98
Class 1: 0.73
Macro Average: Precision: 0.92, Recall: 0.81, F1-Score: 0.85
Weighted Average: Precision: 0.96, Recall: 0.96, F1-Score: 0.96
Discussion and Next Steps
The project demonstrates the power of neural networks in solving classification problems, especially when combined with effective training strategies like early stopping to prevent overfitting. Future improvements might include:

Adding more hidden layers or neurons.
Tuning hyperparameters for better model performance.
Exploring regularization techniques for further robustness.
